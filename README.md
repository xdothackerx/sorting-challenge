<h4>Project Title: Data Structures</h4>
<h5>Author: Sam Camus (xdothackerx) </h5>

This repo holds sample code for a number of classic data structures implemented in Ruby.

The first data structure studied is linked lists, including traversal and adding/removing nodes. The linked list in this version takes the form of a scavenger or treasure hunt.

The second sample models a stack, with push and pop functions. My version mimicks a buffet plate dispenser.

The third example takes the form of a single-file line, which explores the queue data structure.

The fourth example models a binary tree made up of managers and employees.

The fifth explores the implementation of several kinds of sort algorithms
Included are:
- insertion sort
- merge sort
- quick sort
